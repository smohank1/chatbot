## Key Changes from Original Code

### app.py Changes:
✅ Added support for both OPENAI_API_KEY and MYKEY environment variables
✅ Changed to serve index.html as a static file
✅ Added host='0.0.0.0' for external accessibility
✅ Port reads from environment (Render sets PORT)
✅ Debug mode turned off for production
✅ Better error handling and logging
✅ Static folder configured properly

### index.html Changes:
✅ Removed hardcoded localhost URLs
✅ Dynamic BASE_URL using window.location.origin
✅ Works seamlessly in both environments
✅ Added welcome message on load
✅ Improved visual feedback for uploads
✅ Better error messages
✅ Added header with app description

### New Features:
✅ Comprehensive documentation (README + Checklist)
✅ Proper .gitignore to protect sensitive data
✅ render.yaml for one-click deployment
✅ Sample document included for instant demo
✅ Environment variable template

## What's Different for Render?

| Aspect | Local Development | Render Production |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| API Key | .env file (MYKEY or OPENAI_API_KEY) | Environment variable in dashboard |
| Port | 5000 (default) | Dynamic (from PORT env var) |
| Host | 127.0.0.1 | 0.0.0.0 (accessible externally) |
| Debug | True | False |
| Storage | Persistent | Ephemeral (resets on restart) |
| URL | http://localhost:5000 | https://your-app.onrender.com |

## Next Steps

You are now ready to proceed to **Phase 2: GitHub Setup**

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Download all files** from the outputs folder
2. **Copy them** to your local project directory
3. **Create a .env file** locally with your OpenAI API key (for testing)
4. **Test locally** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Then proceed to Render** deployment using the DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

## Important Notes

⚠️ **DO NOT commit your .env file** - It contains your API key!
✅ **DO commit .env.example** - It's just a template
✅ **DO commit the data/ folder** - Sample document is safe to share
🎯 **Remember**: On Render, you'll set OPENAI_API_KEY in the dashboard, not in a file

## Testing Locally (Optional)

Before deploying, you can test locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Visit: http://localhost:5000

5. Try asking: "What's the battery life of the smartwatch?"

## Questions to Ask the Smartwatch (Sample Queries)

Once deployed, you can test with these questions:
- "What's included in the box?"
- "How do I pair the watch with my phone?"
- "What is the water resistance rating?"
- "How long does the battery last?"
- "What sensors does the watch have?"
- "How do I clean the watch?"
- "What's the warranty period?"

**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Complete
**Next**: Push to GitHub, then deploy on Render
**Time Estimate**: 15-20 minutes for Phases 2 & 3

Good luck! 🚀
